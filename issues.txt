Gameplay:
[*] Player's hitbox doesn't give leeway because it covers the entire ship size.
[ ] Polybomb's attacks leave to little space for dodging, specially considering the other bullets all over the space.
[ ] Damage being overlap-per-frame is overly punishing, it disincourages the player to avoid the bullets.
[ ] There's no "safe" side of the screen with random enemy spawing.

Style:
[*] 4 looks to much like a 9 in the current font.

Music:
[ ] Title screen's music is too harsh with repeating monotone blare
